11. Does people care about the price? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

The majority of the most rated apps are free, but on the top20 we have 1/4 of paid apps. So yes, people care about the price but in certain cases, if your app adds enough value, people will be open to buy it
